#Project Name - Graphify

#Abstract

Although Graph theory of storage is becoming de facto solution to today’s need of handling big-data, majority of organizations are still using the relational system mainly for one thing ‘Cost’ of migrating to Graph DB from their legacy system. If there were a tool to analyse your current DB structure and create a schema based on the analysis, it would save a lot of time and hence cost. We would like to create a tool that would provide easy to use user interface (drag and drop, buttons to add relationship), generate schema, create nodes and edges by migrate data from existing DB to new one. We would like to start with migrating MySQL to IBM Graph for two reasons, MySQL being one of the most widely used relational DB and IBM Graph as it has exposed APIs to do data and structure manipulations. This would help the organizations wishing to migrate or use new DB to great extent.

#User Stories

1. As a user with no DB background I want to be able to create new Graph DB just by using drag and drop utilities
2. As a user I want to be able to migrate my existing relational DB to Graph DB
